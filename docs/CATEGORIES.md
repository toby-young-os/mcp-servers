# MCP Server Categories

This repository implements the four primary MCP server categories. Each section below links to a full walkthrough with demos and usage tips.

- [Capability Discovery (`math-capability-registry`)](categories/capability_discovery.md)
- [Data-Providing (`math-data-provider`)](categories/data_provider.md)
- [Prompt-Returning (`math-prompt-helper`)](categories/prompt_helper.md)
- [Autonomous Reasoning (`math-autonomous-reasoner`)](categories/autonomous_reasoner.md)

Use these docs to understand how to run each server, what responses to expect, and how they map to the MCP taxonomy.
